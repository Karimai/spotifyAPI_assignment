Your instructions here please... 

I used the following python packages. I supposed these packages are already installed.
o - json
o - webbrowser
o - getopt
o - requests


The program can be called like this:

$ ./get-token.sh client_id client_secret

note:
- I assumed the track ids are in in tracks.json file which is present in the current directory.
- The default output file is result.html
